# Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Cluster Analysis

Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) are reports which financial instructions are required to file, by law, whenever they identify suspicious or potentially suspicious activity in customerâ€™s accounts. 

This project seeks to identify clear clusters in the public SAR filing data to learn more about the activity and potentially identify any useful information. Clustering will be done on industry, state, product, financial instrument, customer relationship to the institution etc. This will allow for deeper understanding of how suspicious activity is taking place and can be grouped across the entire united states.
